# Always-On Setup

By default, an agent decides whether to load a skill by matching your request against that skill's `description`. That's usually enough — but if you want the agent to actively check **everything installed, from any source**, before it starts on any request, that needs two things working together:

1. **`skill-router`** (in this repo) — an actual skill with a deliberately broad trigger, whose job is to enumerate every installed skill (not just the ones in this repo) and check relevance before proceeding.
2. **A persistent context file** — the one thing your tool is guaranteed to load every session, regardless of skill-matching. No skill can force itself to be read on literally every message; that's controlled by the host tool, not the skill package. The snippet below closes that gap by living in a file the tool always reads.

Install the router along with the rest:

```bash
npx skills add SohailKhan0525/skills --skill skill-router
```

Then add the matching snippet for your tool:

## Claude Code — `CLAUDE.md`

```markdown
## Before starting any substantive request

Check every installed skill (any publisher, not just one repo) for relevance before proceeding — use skill-router if it's installed, or otherwise list the skills directory and check each one's description yourself. Don't skip this because a request seems simple or doesn't obviously match a skill's exact wording.
```

## Cursor — `.cursor/rules/skill-check.mdc`

```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---

Before starting any substantive request, check every installed skill (any publisher) for relevance — use skill-router if installed, or list the skills directory and check descriptions yourself. Don't skip this for requests that seem simple.
```

## Codex / other agents — `AGENTS.md`

```markdown
## Skill check

Before substantive work on any request, check all installed skills (any publisher) for relevance — use skill-router if present, or check the skills directory directly. Applies even to requests that don't obviously match a skill's wording.
```

## Antigravity / Windsurf / others

Same idea — find whatever file that tool loads automatically at session start, and add the same "check all installed skills before proceeding" instruction.

## Why this isn't 100% automatic

A skill is something an agent *can* reach for, not something that reaches into every conversation unconditionally — that's intentional, so skills don't fire on requests they have nothing to do with. `skill-router`'s broad trigger plus a persistent context file are the two real levers available; together they get close to "always check," but neither one alone is a hard guarantee, and no combination is 100% enforceable at the skill-package level — that would require the host tool itself to change how it triggers skills.
