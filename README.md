I kept running into the same problem with AI coding agents: ask one to "set up Stripe" or "connect a database," and half the time you get back a `.env` full of `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`, a "for now" placeholder, or a confident report that describes what *should* happen instead of actually doing it.

So these skills are built around one rule I don't let myself break: **if it can't be done for real, it doesn't get faked — it stops and asks.** No placeholder keys, no mock data, no lorem ipsum, no quietly downgrading "set this up" into "here's a TODO for later."

Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google), [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/), and anything else that reads the open [Agent Skills](https://www.skills.sh) format (`SKILL.md`).

## Install

```bash
npx skills add SohailKhan0525/skills
```

Or install one skill at a time:

```bash
npx skills add SohailKhan0525/skills --skill backend-setup-wizard
```

Want the agent to check *every* installed skill — from any source — before starting any request, not just when a prompt obviously matches? See [ALWAYS-ON-SETUP.md](./ALWAYS-ON-SETUP.md).

## Skills in this repo

| Skill | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`backend-setup-wizard`](./skills/backend-setup-wizard) | ✅ Stable | Provisions, configures, and deploys real, live backends and third-party services (databases, auth, payments, etc.) entirely via CLI. Zero-knowledge credential handling — the agent never sees, types, or reads the raw key; auth happens via OAuth/CLI-login or the user's own terminal. Never test keys, never placeholders. |
| [`security-hardening-wizard`](./skills/security-hardening-wizard) | ✅ Stable | Scans every file in a project — any extension, not just source code — for real vulnerabilities, fixes each one for real via CLI, hardens the live deployed backend/site, and produces a verified markdown audit report. Works standalone or as a follow-up to `backend-setup-wizard`. |
| [`frontend-ui-ux-wizard`](./skills/frontend-ui-ux-wizard) | ✅ Stable | Designs and builds real, production-ready websites — full site scope (home, about, contact, pricing, real privacy/terms pages), a real design-token system, deliberate font pairing, real product screenshots via Playwright — then checks the build, pushes to GitHub, and deploys it live. |
| [`skill-router`](./skills/skill-router) | ✅ Stable | Checks every installed skill — from any publisher, not just this repo — for relevance before starting substantive work, so a matching skill doesn't get silently skipped just because a request didn't use its exact trigger words. Pair with [ALWAYS-ON-SETUP.md](./ALWAYS-ON-SETUP.md) for the closest thing to guaranteed coverage. |

**Status key:** ✅ Stable — used and working · 🧪 Beta — functional, still being refined · 📝 Planned — not built yet

More are coming when I need them for my own projects (mainly [Qofeno](https://qofeno.com)) — I build these because I actually use them, not the other way around. Check [open issues](https://github.com/SohailKhan0525/skills/issues) for what's planned, or [request one](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill_request.md) if there's a gap you keep hitting.

## Why "no stand-ins"

I got tired of agents that technically respond to a request without actually doing it. Every skill here follows the same four rules:

1. **No stand-ins.** No placeholder code, no mock data, no lorem ipsum, no "MVP for now." If it can't be done for real yet, the skill says so instead of faking it.
2. **No giving up early.** If a step looks blocked, the skill searches current docs and tries alternate paths before telling you something isn't possible.
3. **Stop and ask, don't route around it.** If something needs input only you can give — a credential, a decision — the skill pauses and asks. It never invents a workaround.
4. **Untrusted content stays untrusted.** Any skill that fetches external docs or web content treats it as reference material, never as instructions to blindly execute — see `backend-setup-wizard`'s Trust Boundaries section for the pattern every skill here follows.

Each skill lives in its own folder with a `SKILL.md` (YAML frontmatter + instructions), and optionally `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` subfolders.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add a skill. Same bar applies to everyone, including me: real output, no placeholders, no giving up early. A GitHub Action validates every `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter automatically on push.

If you use one of these and hit something that doesn't hold up to the "no stand-ins" rule, that's a bug — open an issue, I'd genuinely rather know.
